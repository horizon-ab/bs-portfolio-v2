# New Website, New Me

It may not be apparent, but this is actually the second version of my personal portfolio. I thought the 
original looked ugly and had too many unnecessary features, so I started from scratch again. This time
I focused on simplicity, cleanliness, and responsiveness, which means only two main pages (Home and Blog), 
no unnecessary animations (no carousels), and actual responsive design (which means that it looks acceptable 
on mobile).

# Happy

It's surprising how easy it feels to remake an entire website when you know what you're doing. It makes me feel
like I understand React much better now. After finishing this website, I'll probably focus on other things for 
the time being.
